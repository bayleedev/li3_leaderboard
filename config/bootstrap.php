 * This is the primary bootstrap file of your application, and is loaded immediately after the front
 * controller (`webroot/index.php`) is invoked. It includes references to other feature-specific
 * bootstrap files that you can turn on and off to configure the services needed for your
 * application.
 *
 * Besides global configuration of external application resources, these files also include
 * configuration for various classes to interact with one another, usually through _filters_.
 * Filters are Lithium's system of creating interactions between classes without tight coupling. See
 * the `Filters` class for more information.
 *
 * If you have other services that must be configured globally for the entire application, create a
 * new bootstrap file and `require` it here.
